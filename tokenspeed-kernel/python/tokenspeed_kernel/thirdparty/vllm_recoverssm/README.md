# vLLM RecoverSSM kernels

This directory contains the Kimi-K3 RecoverSSM implementation copied from
`vllm-project/vllm` commit `c77b3faa1cc2c39edbe82365f28ce96981af1438`.

Upstream file:
`vllm/models/kimi_k3/nvidia/ops/recoverssm.py`.

The source retains the Apache-2.0 license. TokenSpeed adapts the Triton import,
null-state convention and convolution layout helper to remove the vLLM runtime
dependency. The unused vLLM runtime context is omitted.

The producer stores FP32 normalized keys and token-local per-channel decay,
along with FP32 corrections. Recovery consumes these records directly. It does
not repeat key normalization or gate evaluation. State updates remain ordered
FP32 CUDA-core operations. The registered adapter lives under ops/attention/kda.

Main verify consumes BF16 convolution and gate outputs. Main accepted-state
replay instead uses FP32 convolution and gates. The adapted producer therefore
keeps an independent FP32 record recurrence alongside the verify recurrence.
It does not obtain recovery corrections by casting rounded verify inputs.

Convolution prepares verify Q/K after BF16 rounding, then normalizes in FP32.
The gate producer separately prepares verify and replay decay. Independent
CTAs consume these values in one launch, so each CTA holds one state tile.
This preserves the two precision chains and avoids repeated transforms for
each value tile.

Verify uses an explicit Triton Gluon layout: four value rows share a warp,
with eight lanes per key reduction. Token updates stay ordered FP32 CUDA-core
operations. This changes the within-token reduction tree; it does not promise
bitwise equality with main. The strict state and output tolerances are unchanged.
The launch uses one warp and batch-bucketed value tiles. Fixed model-layout
strides specialize address arithmetic; request-dependent group pitches remain
runtime values. Exact request counts do not create new binaries within the
same launch bucket.

Invalid tokens form a suffix in each request. Output and record stores mask
that suffix. Verify does not write the input checkpoint, so it need not retain
the intermediate state after the last valid token. Tests cover ragged lengths,
empty requests, null pages and untouched record suffixes.

Record storage is request-indexed. Batched recovery accepts the existing
group-major state plan and strided layer pointer descriptors. Convolution
commit uses the existing TokenSpeed kernel; unused vLLM convolution helpers
are omitted. The NVIDIA runtime uses this adapter on the development branch.
Accuracy and performance validation are not complete. See
[PR1 progress](../../../../../docs/design/kda-recoverssm-pr1-progress.md).


## Adapter contracts

Recovery consumes saved FP32 K/U/decay. It does not evaluate gates again.
The standalone commit API therefore has no gate weights, gate bound or
per-pool stride-array arguments. Its tensor views provide the strides.
The shared runtime adapter keeps producer-only fields for the other backends;
its docstring identifies the fields that this record-based commit does not use.

The production commit uses a contiguous ten-column pointer table and
contiguous group-major page metadata. The shared state-page planner clamps
accepted counts before this call. Live source and destination pages must be
positive. Padding uses negative pages and zero accepted counts. Each request
owns its writable pages; its own source and destination may alias.

Producer wrappers check shapes, dtypes and strides on the host. These checks
do not read device values. Convolution output is dense even when the input is
a strided projection view. No padding memset is added: graph consumers must
ignore padded outputs under the unified-path contract.

The old all-layer replay kernel remains an offline numerical reference while
PR1 validation is in progress. The NVIDIA serving adapter no longer calls it.
Shared producers and per-layer kernels still used by other paths must not be
removed as part of this cleanup. Final PR cleanup remains a separate pending
milestone; retention here does not add a serving-mode selector.
